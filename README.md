Personal projects

Passionate about coding! My repositories contain my past projects, both academic and personal.

To use the Golf program: download the .zip file and follow instructions in the .txt file inside.
The Golf folder is there if you wantto check out the source code. Or if you want to download the files individually by yourself.
